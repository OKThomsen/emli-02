    "Text": " The image shows an indoor scene with a focus on a white wall. In the bottom right corner, there appears to be a digital device, possibly a router or modem, with cables plugged into it. There is also a small portion of what seems like a computer monitor in the foreground, but it's mostly obscured by other objects. The lighting in the room is dim, and the overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, possibly unoccupied space. There are no texts or distinctive features that provide additional context about the location or purpose of this image. "
